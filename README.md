# Haar Cascade Object Detection

A computer vision project utilizing Haar Cascade Classifiers for real-time object detection. Developed as part of the Machine Learning course (CT-354), this project demonstrates face or feature detection using OpenCV's pretrained Haar models.

## 🔍 Overview

This project implements a Haar Cascade-based detection system to identify facial features like:
- Faces
- Eyes
- Other detectable objects (based on the classifier used)

Haar Cascades are effective for real-time object detection due to their speed and accuracy. This solution processes both image files and live webcam streams.

- **Project Title**: Haar Cascade-based Real-Time Object Detection

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Real-time video processing via webcam
- Multiple object detection using various `.xml` Haar models
- Easy integration with OpenCV projects
- Lightweight and efficient

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3 is installed. Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

**Required Libraries:**

* `opencv-python`
* `numpy`

---

### ▶️ Run the Project

```bash
python haar_detection.py
```

This will open your webcam and start real-time detection. To test with images, modify the script to load a file instead of video stream.

---

## 🧠 Haar Classifiers Used

* `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
* `haarcascade_eye.xml`

These XML files are pretrained classifiers available from OpenCV’s model zoo.

---

## 📷 Sample Results

> ✅ Face and eye detection results with bounding boxes
> *(Add screenshots in this section after running the project)*

---

## 📝 Notes

* Make sure the XML files are in the correct directory.
* Lighting and camera quality affect detection performance.
* Haar Cascades are fast but may lack deep learning-level accuracy.
